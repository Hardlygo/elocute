Elocute is a mobile app for students that helps language teachers move from an onsite language lab to a fully mobile one, so that their students can practice reading texts aloud to perfect their accent. A speech-to-text integration and scoring algorithm gives immediate feedback to students as they read their teachers' assignments. Teachers set up classrooms and assign texts in the mobile app. Visit [Elocute.me](http://www.elocute.me) for more information and to get started!
